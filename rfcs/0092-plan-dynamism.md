# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Guarded under an experimental feature, introduce three fundamental new features:
- The ability to have derivations which output store paths end in `.drv`
  (e.g. `$out` is /nix/store/something.drv).
- The ability for a derivation to depend on the output of a derivation,
  that isn't yet built but has to be built by another derivation.
- A primitive `builtins.outputOf` to make use of this feature from within
  the Nix language.

These features work best in combination with Recursive Nix, such that you
can add to the host store from within the build.
It can replace invoking `nix build` within a build with a mechanism
that works better with the design constraints of Nix.

Notable improvements it allows:
- We can split up big builds like the Linux kernel into
  smaller derivations without introducing automatically generated
  code into Nixpkgs.
- We can do the above automatically for many *2nix tools,
  allowing us to have source-file-level derivations for most
  languages (forget crate-level!).
- We can fetch Merkle trees by just knowing the hash of the root,
  with Θ(n) derivations for n nodes in the tree.
- It is a better way of evaluating Nix code inside a build compared
  to standard Recursive Nix, and can serve as an alternative to **i**mport-**f**rom-**d**erivation
  in many cases. (IFD is where you import the output of a derivation into
  the "evaluation stage", e.g. `import drv` or `builtins.readFile drv`).

NB: This is **not** a replacement for Recursive Nix. We still need the ability to
access the store inside the build for many usages of this RFC's features.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

> Instead of Recursive Nix builds, the alternative is to have one gigantic build graph.
> For instance, if we are building a component that needs a C compiler, the Nix expression for that component simply imports the Nix expression that builds the compiler.
> The problem with this approach is scalability: the resulting build graphs would become huge.
> The graph for a simple component such as GNU Hello would include the build graphs for dozens of large components, such as Glibc, GCC, etc.
> The resulting graph could easily have hundreds of thousands of nodes, far exceeding the graphs typically occurring in deployment (e.g., the one in Figure 1.5).
> However, apart from its efficiency, this is possibly the most desirable solution because of its conceptual simplicity.
> Thus it is interesting to develop efficient ways of dealing with very large build graphs

Nix's design encourages a separation of build *planning* from build *execution*:
evaluation of the Nix language produces derivations, and then then those derivations are built.
This usually a great thing.
It's enforced the separation of the more complex Nix expression language from the simpler derivation language.
It's also encouraged Nixpkgs to take the "birds eye" view and successful grapple a ton of complexity that would have overwhelmed a more traditional package repository.

The core feature here, derivations that build derivations, is a nice sneaky fundamental primitive for the problem Eelco point's out.

It's very performant, being well-adapted for Nix's current scheduler.
Unlike Recursive Nix, there's is no potential for half-built dependencies to sit around waiting for other builds, wasting resources.
Each build step (derivation) always runs start to finish blocking on nothing.
It's very efficient, because it doesn't obligate the use of the Nix expression language.

It's also quite compatible with `--dry-run`.
Because derivations don't get new dependencies *mid build*, we have no need to mess with individual steps to explore the plan.
There still becomes multiple sorts of `--dry-run` policies, but all of them just have to do with building or not buidling derivations which *themselves* are unchanged.

To make that more, clear, if you *do* want one big ("hundreds of thousands of nodes"-big), static graph, you can still have it!
Build all the derivations that compute derivations, but not nothing else.
Then the results of those can be substituted (think partial eval, also remember we already do this sort of thing for CA derivations), and one has just that.

If one *doesn't* want that however, do a normal build, and graph in "goals" form in Nixpkgs can stay small.
Graphs evaluate into large graphs, but goals are GC'd as they are built.
This keeps the "working set" small, at least in the archetypal use-case where the computed subgraphs are disjoint, coming from the `Makefile`s of individual packages.

Finally there is a sense in which this extension is very natural.
The opening sentence of every revised scheme report is:

> Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature,
> but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.

We already have a dynamic scheduler that doesn't need to know all the goals up front.
We also already rewrite derivations based on previous builds for CA-derivations.
All the underlying mechanisms are thus there, and the patch implementing this in a sense wrote itself.

Now, there is a good argument that maybe the Nix derivation language today has other implementation strategies where this *wouldn't* be so natural and easy.
This is like saying "we can add this axiom for free in our current model, but not in all possible models of our current axioms".
Well, if such a concrete other strategy ever arises, it is very easy to statically prohibit the new features this RFC proposes.
Until then, down with the artificial restrictions!

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Really, this RFC is just proposing that we create the experimental feature.
All details are subject to change.
But so we aren't just proposing an arbitrary experiment, with nothing concrete to judge, we include here the initial design.

We can break the initial experimental feature down nicely into steps.

*This is implemented in https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/4628.*

1. Derivation outputs can be valid derivations.
   \[If one tries to output a drv file today, they will find Nix doesn't accept the output as such because these small paper cuts.
   This list item and its children should be thought of as "lifting artificial restrictions".\]

   1. Allow derivation outputs to be content-addressed in the same manner as drv files.
      (`outputHashMode = "text";`, see [Advanced Attributes](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/expressions/advanced-attributes.html)).

   2. Lift the (perhaps not yet documented) restriction barring derivations output paths from ending in `.drv`, but only for derivation outputs that are so content-addressed.
      \[There are probably other ways to make store paths that end in `.drv` that aren't valid derivations, so we could make the simpler change of lifting this restriction entirely without breaking invariants. But I'm fine keeping it for the wrong sorts of derivations as a useful guard rail.\]

2. Extend the CLI to take advantage of such derivations:

   We hopefully will soon allow CLI "installable" args in the form
   ```
   single-installable ::= <path> ! <output-name>
   ```
   where the first path is a derivation, and the second is the output we want to build.

   We should generalize the grammar like so:
   ```
   single-installable ::= <single-installable> ! <output-name>
                       |  <path>

   multi-installable  ::= <single-installable>
                       |  <single-installable> ! *
   ```

   Plain paths just mean that path itself is the goal, while `!` indexing indicates one more outputs of the derivation to the left of the `!` is the goal.

   > For example,
   > ```
   > nix build /nix/store/…foo.drv
   > ```
   > would just obtain `/nix/store/…foo.drv` and not build it, while
   > ```
   > nix build /nix/store/…foo.drv!*
   > ```
   > would obtain (by building or substituting) all its outputs.
   > ```
   > nix build /nix/store/…foo.drv!out!out
   > ```
   > would obtain the `out` output of whatever derivation `/nix/store/…foo.drv!out` produces.

   Now that we have `path` vs `path!*`, we also don't need `--derivation` as a disambiguator, and so that should be removed along with all the complexity that goes with it.
   (`toDerivedPathsWithHints` in the the nix commands should always be pure functions and not consult the store.)

3. Extend the scheduler and derivation dependencies similarly:

  - Derivations can depend on the outputs of derivations that are themselves derivation outputs.
    The scheduler will substitute derivations to simplify dependencies as computed derivations are built, just like how floating content-addressed derivations are realized.

  - Missing derivations get their own full fledged goals so they can be built, not just fetched from substituters.

4. Add a new `outputOf` primop:

   `builtins.outputOf drv outputName` produces a placeholder string with the appropriate string context to access the output of that name produced by that derivation.
   The placeholder string is quite analogous to that used for floating content-addressed derivation outputs.
   \[With just floating content-addressed derivations but no computed derivations, derivations are always known statically but their outputs aren't.
   With this RFC, since drv files themselves can be floating CA derivation outputs, we also might not know the derivations statically, so we need "deep" placeholders to account for arbitrary layers of dynamism.
   This also corresponds to the use of arbitrary many `!` in the CLI.\]

# Examples and Interactions
[examples-and-interactions]: #examples-and-interactions

A good example is available at https://github.com/L-as/nix-build.nix.

Specifically, we can do the following:
```nix
{ pkgs, nixBuild }:

let
  drv = pkgs.runCommand "hello-drv.nix" {} ''
    echo "with import ${pkgs.path} {}; hello" > $out
  '';
in
nixBuild pkgs.system "hello" drv
```

`nixBuild` essentially runs the following builder internally:
```bash
cp $(nix-instantiate $input) $out
```

However, you don't have to use the Nix language, nor do you have to use `nix-instantiate`.
The following also works:
```bash
cat > $out <<END
Derive([("out","/nix/store/15c875mwri8xx3s0gqsdkdw7sqqyv55c-hello-2.10","","")],[("/nix/store/3x7l9pm7hqbhz2s59hsrg2y1dxr8glw8-hello-2.10.tar.gz.drv",["out"]),("/nix/store/bqfy8ydlxs0xhzqmy7rc3zjw60vwab6j-stdenv-linux.drv",["out"]),("/nix/store/k6c94x4g937sh8wh5sx90czd9wn9apks-bash-5.1-p8.drv",["out"])],["/nix/store/9krlzvny65gdc8s7kpb6lkx8cd02c25b-default-builder.sh"],"x86_64-linux","/nix/store/wadmyilr414n7bimxysbny876i2vlm5r-bash-5.1-p8/bin/bash",["-e","/nix/store/9krlzvny65gdc8s7kpb6lkx8cd02c25b-default-builder.sh"],[("buildInputs",""),("builder","/nix/store/wadmyilr414n7bimxysbny876i2vlm5r-bash-5.1-p8/bin/bash"),("configureFlags",""),("depsBuildBuild",""),("depsBuildBuildPropagated",""),("depsBuildTarget",""),("depsBuildTargetPropagated",""),("depsHostHost",""),("depsHostHostPropagated",""),("depsTargetTarget",""),("depsTargetTargetPropagated",""),("doCheck","1"),("doInstallCheck",""),("name","hello-2.10"),("nativeBuildInputs",""),("out","/nix/store/15c875mwri8xx3s0gqsdkdw7sqqyv55c-hello-2.10"),("outputs","out"),("patches",""),("pname","hello"),("propagatedBuildInputs",""),("propagatedNativeBuildInputs",""),("src","/nix/store/3x7dwzq014bblazs7kq20p9hyzz0qh8g-hello-2.10.tar.gz"),("stdenv","/nix/store/qcq1y0nfxv8za7w6c682s93gk87r2xy1-stdenv-linux"),("strictDeps",""),("system","x86_64-linux"),("version","2.10")])
END
```

The way you would use a derivation that outputs a derivation to `out` is then
as such:
```nix
{ pkgs, drv }:

pkgs.runCommand "example" {} ''
  ls ${builtins.outputOf drv.out "out"} > $out
''
```

Given a path to a derivation that might not yet be built, `builtins.outputOf`
gives us the path to an output of it.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- We add a bit of complexity to Nix.
- There is currently no way of getting a "derivation object"
  as you do from `builtins.derivation` with `builtins.outputOf`.
  There are reasons for why this can't be done, mainly that you
  don't actually know the attributes the built derivation will have,
  but it might be an ergonomic issue.
- This is for many things not an alternative to IFD, since we
  still can not build derivations and then use them at evaluation
  time, meaning that you can't have an attribute set whose contents
  are determined by some build, and then access that attribute set
  outside of build that dependens on that derivation.
- We unfortunately expose the `text` `outputHashMode` to users.
  Preferably this should be removed entirely, in addition to `flat`,
  and everything should just use `recursive`.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Restrict ourselves to a subset of what we can do with this RFC,
  and implement that using only Recursive Nix without making use
  of this RFC.
  Notably, we can still run `nix build` at the end of builds. This isn't as great,
  since 1) the daemon will consider the build doing `nix build`
  as an active build, 2) it messes with logging, often the log
  of a failing inner build will not be easily accessible, and
  3) we can't actually have derivations that output derivations.
- Do nothing, and continue to have no good answer for large builds like Linux and Chromium.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- The exact way the outputs refer to the replacement derivations / their outputs is subject to bikeshedding.
- Do we need the new CLI?
- Can we make `builtins.outputOf` more ergonomic?

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

1. Actually use this stuff in Nixpkgs with modification to the existing "lang2nix" tools.
   This is the lowest hanging fruit and most import thing.

2. Try to breach the build system package manager divide.
   Just as there are foreign packages graphs to convert to Nix, there are Ninja and Make graphs we can also convert to Nix.
   This might really help with big builds like Chromium and LLVM.

3. Try to convince upstream tools to use Nix like CMake, Meson, etc. use Ninja.
   Rather than converting Ninja plans, we might convince those tools to have purpose-built Nix backends.
   Language-specific package managers that don't use Ninja today might also be modified to "let Nix do that actual building".

4. Another RFC when we finalize the feature and propose its stabilization.
   This is a bit speculative, as we haven't pinned down an official experimental feature process/lifecycle.
   But we include it here to reiterate this RFC is *not* mandating the final design.
