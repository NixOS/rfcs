# Summary
[summary]: #summary

The NixOS community, up to this point, has _de facto_ operated in an open and
transparent fasion. Whether it be in discussions on Matrix, Discourse, GitHub,
in person at NixCon, or financial decision making via Open Collective,
the community has demonstrated by its actions that it values openness and
auditability in communication and decision making. We should therefore codify
this ideal as a guaranteed community standard.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

It has recently come to the author's attention that a private, invite only,
chatroom has been created on the official NixOS Matrix Space. This seems to be
a hard break from the above mentioned ideal of openness and transparency and
has, therefore, triggered this RFC. There is no argument against the existence
of any such room in principle, only that it not be officially sanctioned by the
project unless any such channel be willing to act in an open and auditable
fashion.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

In an effort to promote transparency, we make it official policy that anything
hosted under `nixos.org` be made and kept public. Should this RFC be accepted,
the transition should be organized and enacted within a reasonable time frame,
no later than two months from the date of acceptance.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Given that opening a private channel on another host is trivial, there do not
seem to be any major drawbacks.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

* Allow private channels under certain well defined circumstances
* Allow private channels with no restrictions
* Keep the current ambiguous state of affairs

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

* Do we endorse privacy on our hosted channels at higher levels than transparency?
* What are the implications for the community if private channels _are_ allowed?

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

Ensure any newly created communication channels are made public from their
inception.
