# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Add a way for users to use experimental Nix features with improved user-experience
and better communication to the user that they are using an experimental feature.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Motivation:
- Revert of (this)[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/123898].
- Noticed quite a few peeps who were very supportive of [this](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/120141) PR (which got reverted).
- Lack of visibility for the end-users that they are using experimental features.

Expected outcome:
- Improved UX.
- Reduced risk of users using experimental features in production environments.
- Reduced non-bug questions/issues on common support channels.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

`nix` derivation definitions should be updated in such a way so end users would be able to overwrite features with something along the lines of this:
```nix
nix.override { experimentalFeatures = ["flakes"]; }
```

What's so special about this override:
- Passes configure flag which looks something like this: `--with-experimental-features="nix-command flakes"`
- Allows building `nix` with selected features enabled by the default
- When using these overwritten derivations warningÂ should be shown.


Warning expected to look something like this:
```
WARNING: You are using experimental Nix features which are up to a subject to change. For more information visit https://nixos.org/xyz
```

Currently, experimental features are undiscoverable and undocumented. It would be nice if there was a way to query which experimental features are available in a Nix release, and to get some documentation about them (like a link to an associated RFC and possibly links to additional resources)

# Examples and Interactions
[examples-and-interactions]: #examples-and-interactions

If we take Nix flakes as an example:
The additional line to `nix.conf` is not a deal-breaker for anyone who decides to
use Nix Flakes. Even if someone were to do so in a production environment is
likely to get by unnoticed. On another hand, if there is an explicit warning it is
likely to make multiple peeps question their decisions.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- In case of addition of 'warning' - it may end up being bothersome


# Alternatives

Not doing this would preserve a lack of visibility. Especially when using projects like [DevOS](https://github.com/divnix/devos) or [flake-utils-plus](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/flake-utils-plus/)

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

How exactly warning should look like?
How exactly `experimentalFeatures` feature flag should be implemented? (Via CLI argument? Env variable? Dynamically generated patch/sed?)

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

Removal/Deprecation of Nix experimental packages on a per case basis.
