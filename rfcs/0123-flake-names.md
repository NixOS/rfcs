# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Flakes can declare the field `name`.  
It represents the name of the flake.  
The store paths corresponding to a flake source are no longer called `source`, but use the flake name.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

- Flake-centric workflows often end up with a lot of derivations named “source”, and it’s difficult to navigate this.
- This metadata can be used to make flakes more discoverable and usable, in particular, it can be output instead or with the URI, making the command friendlier.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

A new supported property for flakes is introduced, `name`.  
The derivation that contains the flake’s content is called `flake-source-${name}`  

# Examples and Interactions
[examples-and-interactions]: #examples-and-interactions

Running `nix flake metadata` on a flake that declares this field displays it at the top.  
Running `nix flake show` on a flake that declares this field shows the name instead of the URL, followed by the URL in parentheses.

Examples:

File `/example/flake.nix`
```nix
{
  name = "example";
  outputs = { ... }: {
    lib.example = "example";
  };
}
```

Shell
```console
$ nix eval git+file:///example
[…] copying flake-source-example
"example"
```

Example of interactions:

Shell (using the previous file)
```
$ nix flake metadata /example
Name:          example
Resolved URL:  git+file:///example
Locked URL:    …
$ nix flake show /example
example (git+file:///home/anselmschueler/Code/example?rev=b0&rev=c714c8624f5d49a9d88e6e24550dd88515923c18)
└───lib: unknown
```

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- This may cause clutter and additional maintenance.
- Since this changes the output of nix flake metadata and nix flake show, it might cause scripts that read this output to break.
- This requires a significant change to the way flakes are handled.
- This treats the Nix store as a user-facing part of Nix, which is generally not intended.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Flake names could be handled entirely through outside means, with things like the global registry merely pointing to flakes under names.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

- The name scheme could be changed. `flake-source-${name}` could be too long. Alternatives include `source-${name}`.
- The interactions with nix flake metadata and nix flake show are not critical to the design, which is mostly aimed at clarifying derivation names.

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

- Flake usability can be improved.
- Issues with indicipherable derivations named “source” also exist elsewhere.
