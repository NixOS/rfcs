# Summary
[summary]: #summary

When updating or modifying packages, several conventions for testing regressions
have been adopted. However, these practices are not standard, and generally it's not well
defined how each testing method should be implemented. It would be beneficial to have
an unambiguous way to say that a given package, and all downstream dependencies, have
had as many automated test ran possible. This will give a high degree of certainty that
a given change is less likely to manifest regressions once introduced on a release
channel.

Another desire of this rfc is also to have a way for various review tools
(e.g. ofborg, hydra, nixpkgs-review) to have a standard way to determine if a
package has additional tests which can help verify its correctness.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Breakages are a constant painpoint for nixpkgs. It is a very poor user experience to
have a configuration broken because one or more packages fail to build. Often when
these breakages occur, it is because the change had a large impact on the entirety
of nixpkgs; and unless there's a dedicated hydra jobset for the pull request, it's
infeasible to expect pull request authors to verify every package affected
by a change they are proposing. However, it is feasible to specify packages that
are very likely to be affected by changes in another package, and use this information
to help mitigate regressions from appearing in release channels.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Standardize `tests.<name>` (commonly set with the `passthru.tests.<name>` argument to `mkDerivation`) as a mechanism of 
more expensive but automatic testing for nixpkgs. As well as encourage the usage of
`checkPhase` or `installCheckPhase` when packaging within nixpkgs.

Criteria for `tests.<name>`:
- Running tests which include downstream dependencies.
  - This avoids cyclic dependency issues for test suites.
- Running lengthy or more resource expensive tests.
  - There should be a priority on making package builds as short as possible.
  - This reduces the amount of compute required for everyone reviewing, building, or iterating on packages.
- Referencing downstream dependencies which are most likely to experience regressions.
  - Most applicable to [RFC 0088 - Nixpkgs Breaking Change Policy](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/88),
as this will help define what breakages a pull request author should take ownership.
- Running integration tests (E.g. nixosTests)
  - Tests which have heavy usage or platform requirements should add the appropriate systemFeature
    - E.g. `nixos-test` `kvm` `big-parallel`

Usage for mkDerivation's `checkPhase`:
- Quick "cheap" tests, which run units tests and maybe some addtional scenarios.
- Since this contributes to the "build time" of a package, there should be some
emphasis on ensuring this phase isn't bloated.

Usage for mkDerivations `installCheckPhase`:
- A quick trivial example (e.g. `<command> --help`) to demonstrate that one (or more)
of the programs were linked correctly.
- Assert behavior post installation (e.g. python's native extensions only get installed
and are not present in a build directory)

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

None? This is opt-in behavior for package maintainers.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

Continue to use current ad-hoc conventions.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

How far should testing go?
- What consistitutes that "enough testing" was done to a package before a change was merged?

Hydra: How would this look for hydra adoption and hydraChecks?

# Future work
[future]: #future-work

One problem with onboarding more tests to the current nixpkgs CI and processes is the increased
need of compute, storage, and ram resources. Therefore, consideration of future work should
take into consideration how much testing is feasible for a given change.

Onboarding of CI tools to support testing paradigms:
- nixpkgs-review
  - Run `<package>.tests` on affected packages
  - Allow for filtering based upon requiredSystemFeatures
- ofborg
  - Testing of `<package>.tests` is already done.

Nixpkgs:
- Add existing nixosTests to related packages
- Update testing clause on PR template
- Update contributing documentation
