# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Expand x86 32 bit support to processors older than i686.  Currently `i686` in nix is overloaded to mean both "32 bit x86" and "exactly the i686 architecture".  This rfc adds the more general term `x86_32` to mean "32 bit x86" which includes the i686 but also includes i586, i486, and other variants.


# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

To enable the use of embedded x86 SoCs such as the i586 [Vortex86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex86) with nix.  I personally would like to use nix on this CPU.


# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Introduce the predicate `isx86_32` which is symmetric to the already existing `isx86_64`.  `isx86_32` will mean "32 bit x86" and the existing `isi686` will be reinterpreted as "exactly i686 architecture".

For i686 this change is effectively a low-risk no-op because `isx86_32` and `isi686` will produce the same result.  Only when the CPU is changed to `i[345]86` does the distinction begin to matter.

The `i[345]86` CPUs will now parse and may be used in system and config descriptions (example "i586-unknown-linux-gnu" and "i486-linux").  Usages of `isi686` in various packages will be flipped to `isx86_32` as needed to make them work on these CPUs.

In testing i586 cross compile support, the only changes I've had to make were general cross compile changes and disambiguation of `isi686`/`isx86_32`.  No i586-specific changes had to be made.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- i586 and predecessors are already uncommon and use continues to diminish.

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

- Use `x86` instead of `x86_32`: This term already has amiguity and should be avoided.  nix considers x86_64 to be in the x86 "family".  The linux kernel considers 32 and 64 bit intel CPUs to all be "x86".  `x86_32` removes all opportunity for confusion.
- `isexactlyi686`: In addition to adding `isx86_32`, rename `isi686` as `isexactlyi686`.  This intentionally breaks all current uses of `isi686` and forces developers to decide whether `isx86_32` or `isexactlyi686` was intended.  This quickly gets us to a more "correct" nixpkgs but the risk of breakage for innocent bystanders is likely not worth it.


# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

Other variants such as Cyrix 6x86, which is somewhere between i586 and i686, are not considered here.

Should the x86 CPUs have a version number like the ARM CPUs do?

# Future work

None known.
