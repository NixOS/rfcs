# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This PR proposes a complete overhaul of the current Code of Conduct and moderation policies and practices
in the NixOS community. The goal is to make the Code of Conduct actionable and clear (i.e. with as little room for
arbitrary interpretation as possible) and make moderation practices more transparent, traceable to the CoC and
accountable.

The spirit of this RFC is that of a modern legal system: the CoC corresponds to the law/rule, the moderators
corresponds to the judge and the moderation actions corresponds to the court.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Currently the Code of Conduct is very vague and open to interpretation. (TBA)

Moderation actions on the official Discourse is opaque. Moderation in general is arbitrary, in the sense that there's
significant room of personal opinion when deciding what is and isn't acceptable behavior, and they are not backed by
the CoC. (TBA)

In light of the recent events, there's also significant doubt of the moderation team coming from the community.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

Design criterions for the CoC:

1. Actionable: The CoC should make clear what are the
associated punishment for the violation.
2. Clear: The CoC should be as clear as possible. It should be
markedly clear where human interpretation is allowed (and to what
degree) and where it is not.
3. Democratic: The CoC should reflect the concensus of the community

Rules for moderation:
1. Transparent: moderation actions should be visible to anyone
2. Traceable: moderation actions need to be justified by particular
clauses in the CoC
3. Accountable: abuse of moderation power should have associated punishment
