# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This detail from the original RFC is being changed
> Previous committers are moved to a new Nixpkgs Committers Emeritus team, to honor their past contributions. Members of this team will remain in the GitHub organisation, and may regain push access at a later time.
>

We are going to rename the Nixpkgs Committers Emeritus Team to Retired Nixpkgs Contributors Team. This seems most appropriate since it was actually the title of the original RFC.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Emeritus is a singular adjective so using it for team members is incorrect:

> Alumna (emerita) is singular female.
Jane is an alumna. Jane is an emerita.
>
> Alumnus (emeritus) is singular male.
John is an alumnus. John is an emeritus.
>
> Alumnae (emeritae) is plural female.
Jane and Mary are alumnae. Jane and Mary are emeritae.
>
> Alumni (emeriti) is plural male and plural when both men and women are included.
John, Jane and Mary are alumni. John, Jane and Mary are emeriti.

Additionally, it isn't a very accessible word in English, so I believe "Retired" would just be fine.
