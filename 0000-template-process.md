# Current Process
[as-is]: #current-process

# Roles & Stakeholders

<!-- 
Stakeholders are people who have an interest in the outcome of this RFC.

Please describe in abstract terms the roles involved in this process
and how they are affected by this process change. Plotting estimated
/ abstract time requirements of _as-is_ against _to-be_ is a plus.
The idea is to get a better sense of the stakeholders of this process
and their respective interestes and estimate the associated total
costs imposed (mostly in time, can be negative) to the community.

Typical stakeholders involve: maintainers, end users, corporate users
